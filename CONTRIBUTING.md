Guidelines for making contributions

This document contains information and recommendations for contributing to this project. Please read this before you start participating.

A great way to contribute to a project is to send a detailed message about the problem when you encounter it. We always appreciate a well-written, detailed bug report.

Make sure that the project's issue database does not already contain this issue or suggestion before submitting the issue. If you find a match, quickly add "+1" or "I have this problem too". This helps to prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting problems, please indicate the following:

The version of Xcode you are using
The iOS or macOS version you are targeting
Full output of any stack trace or compiler error
A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
Any other details that would be helpful to understand the problem
This information will help us to review and fix your problem faster.
